# Redux Toolkit Quick Start

## Usage Summaryâ€‹

### Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux

Add the Redux Toolkit and React-Redux packages to your project

```shell
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### Create a Redux Store

Create a file named `src/app/store.js`. Import the `configureStore API` from Redux Toolkit. We'll start by creating an empty Redux store, and exporting it:

```javascript
// app/store.js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
});
```

This creates a Redux store, and also automatically configure the Redux DevTools extension so that you can inspect the store while developing.

### Provide the Redux Store to React

Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux `<Provider>` around our application in `src/index.js`. Import the Redux store we just created, put a `<Provider>` around your `<App>`, and pass the store as a prop.

```javascript
// index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import { store } from "./app/store";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### Create a Redux State Slice

Add a new file named `src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`. In that file, import the `createSlice` API from Redux Toolkit.

Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.

Redux requires that we write all state updates immutably, by making copies of data and updating the copies. However, Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` and `createReducer` APIs use Immer inside to allow us to write "mutating" update logic that becomes correct immutable updates.

```javascript
// features/counter/counterSlice.js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
};

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### Add Slice Reducers to the Store

Next, we need to import the reducer function from the counter slice and add it to our store. By defining a field inside the `reducer` parameter, we tell the store to use this slice reducer function to handle all updates to that state.

```javascript
// app/store.js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

### Use Redux State and Actions in React Components

Now we can use the React-Redux hooks to let React components interact with the Redux store. We can read data from the store with `useSelector`, and dispatch actions using `useDispatch`. Create a `src/features/counter/Counter.js` file with a `<Counter>` component inside, then import that component into `App.js` and render it inside of `<App>`.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { decrement, increment } from "./counterSlice";

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          Decrement
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, any time you click the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons.

- The corresponding Redux action will be dispatched to the store
- The counter slice reducer will see the actions and update its state
- The `<Counter>` component will see the new state value from the store and re-render itself with the new data

## SUMMARY

- Create a Redux store with `configureStore`
  - `configureStore` accepts a `reducer` function as a named argument
  - `configureStore` automatically sets up the store with good default settings
- Provide the Redux store to the React application components
  - Put a React-Redux `<Provider>` component around your `<App />`
  - Pass the Redux store as `<Provider store={store}>`
- Create a Redux "slice" reducer with `createSlice`
  - Call `createSlice` with a string name, an initial state, and named reducer functions
  - Reducer functions may "mutate" the state using Immer
  - Export the generated slice reducer and action creators
- Use the React-Redux `useSelector/useDispatch` hooks in React components
  - Read data from the store with the `useSelector` hook
  - Get the `dispatch` function with the `useDispatch` hook, and dispatch actions as needed
